# Bank_loan_project
<h1> Project description</h1>
 <p>
  This project is a bank loan classifier Approved/Not Approved.
  Dataset is taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaurbegiev/my-dataset" target="_blank" >Kaggle</a>.
  This task I have made for practice in XGBoost and integrating model into Django.
  </p>
  <p>
  I used XGBoost Classifier with hyperparameters tuning using validation data. Accuracy on test data were 77%,
  ROC AUC were 0.64, Precision were 81%.
  <br>
  Also I made feature selection and their analysis. You can download my solution and sklearn pipeline with model and
  <a href="https://disk.yandex.ru/d/k4YBueG9MIEVUg" target="_blank">dataset </a> from Yandex disk.
